## Instructions

When the game starts, all cards are turned face down. The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them. If the two card have the same icon, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a short period of time.

The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face-up in the least number of tries. That means that a lower number of attempts scores better.

## Contributing

you will do some routine work - connecting files to the `index.html`, so we make sure styles and JS files are loading when we open the game in the browser. Then you will proceed to work on the game logic and making sure everything works properly just by printing all desired results in the console. When the logic is down, you will move forward to `js/app.js` and work on the interactions - what happens when user clicks on the card: how do we get the movement/flipping sides effect, how we keep the cards showing images if they are found to be the same and how we make cards flip back to blue background if the cards are not the same. All the time keep in mind, we need to work only with two cards at the same time.

_Let's do this in JavaScript using DOM manipulation!_

**Happy coding!** :heart:
